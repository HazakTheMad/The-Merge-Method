A wip way to mod Skyrim Special Edition

# The Merge Method

"The Merge Method" is a modified version of a modding technique and guide called "The Method."
The main differences between the Method and the Merge Method is at the end of the Merge Method you will attempt to have 
as few as possible plugins and all loose assets combined in multiple BSAs.

## Getting Started

First off, you are going to need some tools.

1. [xEdit](https://github.com/TES5Edit/TES5Edit/releases/)
2. [MO2](https://github.com/ModOrganizer2/modorganizer/releases)
3. [xEdit Script](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/37981/?tab=files)

I suggest making a folder somewhere like C:\ called Modding, within there I suggest a folder called tools,
put xEdit there and install a portable MO2 instance there.
Should look like C:\Modding\Tools with your tools in there.
